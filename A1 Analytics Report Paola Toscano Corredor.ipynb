    "We are Tosco Sports Inc. a company committed to sell high-quality products to our customers. Our main objective is an international expansion, as our main growth strategy, in order to explore more market opportunities and expand our operations. The ultimate goal of this is to reach a market that will help us to increase our number of customers, revenues, keep our operation systems on track, and to realize various strategies that will allow us to be leaders in the sports industry. The new location will have to meet our company's vision and mission, keep the high quality products and strong operations we have.\n",

    "\n",
    "Taking into account that there are many economic variables that can be analyzed in different countries worldwide, the most important ones for this market study have been: Cost of living, Local Purchasing Power Index, Safety Index, and Household Expenditure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of living allows us to know the expenses that the population of a country has to acquire physical or material goods. The Purchasing Power is another fundamental factor since it is the amount of goods and services that a person within that country can buy with a certain amount of money. The analysis of these two economic and internal factors of the countries at world level are important for the international expansion of our company because it allows us to compare the costs of doing business and the purchasing power of consumers in the region.\n",
    "\n",
    "After analyzing the data on these economic factors, we have obtained as results that the United States is a country with a high value in both the Local Purchasing Power and the Cost of Living. With this we can say that it is a country with strong and stable economy with high levels of consumer demand, which can create a favorable market for our products. Additionally, the difference between Cost of Living and Local Purchasing Power values means that consumers in the US have more disposable income, something that can help us increase sales and revenue. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, we have the Safety and Household Expenditure Indexes. It is fundamental that the country we are planning to expand among the first in terms of security. Today, we are in a developed continent and country, France, where people feel safe buying products and services of all kinds. A deep analysis has shown that the United States is the country with the highest Household Expenditure in the world, a factor that allows us to know how much each family spends buying goods and services of all kinds. Additionally, is in the top 15 of safest countries around the world.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Imports are an important factor to analyze when expanding in the international market. This allows us to identify market opportunities and anticipate challenges such as pricing and regulatory issues. Having solved problem 1 (where to expand), we have analyzed how imports into the U.S. are faring in relation to goods entering from developed countries outside the region, i.e., Europe, Middle East, Asia, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results show that since 2000, the United States has had a growth in imports (US million). All this is an opportunity for the company introduce the products to US consumers, since the increase in imports from developed countries may indicate a growing demand for foreign products in the US market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it was important to analyze how are the exports in France. This is because we are currently operating from here and it is essential to know how the country of departure is in terms of exports, but also with this we can identify potential trade barriers. The results obtained indicate that France has had a slightly increase in the exports, which means that its trade performance is positive and is selling goods and services to other countries outside the region.\n"

Moving products across borders is a necessary part of the expansion strategy, but it may be challenging and requires careful logistics and transportation planning. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have had as main result, that the United States is the first country in sales in terms of shipment of completed orders, with a total of more than 2 million USD, all this assuming that the orders have been sent from this country. With this total, it can be said that the United States has a supply chain that meets the expectations of the market and that being first place in completed orders says that the quality control, and transportation and logistics meet the standards that we are expecting from a new country to have our operations.\n",

    "On the other hand, the United States is a country that has a free trade agreement with Mexico, a country that is in 3rd place, after France, in terms of sales in completed orders, saying that it also has a good quality control in its supply chain. With all this, it can be said that Mexico can be a future market for the operation, not only because it is in North America but also because it is very close to the United States in terms of trade and has generated high sales for its supply chain, which will allow to expand the operation much easier to Latin America, for the future.\n",
